# Growth-And-Form
Explore the relation between the growth of structures (like bacteria) and their shape/function

10/24/2017. Tuesday. Starting the mesh methods script and energy functions.

-started MeshDealer and EnergyDrinks. 
- I'm generating a triangular mesh on a cylinder.
- Then define useful methods and data structures related to it's edge data.
- This data will be used to calculate energy and other geometric function like curvature. 
- I building up to defining an elastic energy in a way that is computationally efficient.
- I will try this out on "benchmark" elasticity problems.
